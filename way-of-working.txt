Ah I see where you're going wrong. Features, fixes should be their own independent changes. The release script is designed to release a set of commits all in own go. So your workflow should look something like
1/ Make a change in a file (let's assume it's a fix)
2/ Stage files
3/ npm run commit to use the interface to create the text
4/ Repeat steps 1-3 as many times as you want until you're ready to release
5/ Increase the version in package.json (but don't commit it)
6/ npm run release:git
7/ Optionally do npm run gh-pages

It might help to see the workflow I use in a real project: https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-calendar/commits/master

Hope that helps! ðŸ˜„
